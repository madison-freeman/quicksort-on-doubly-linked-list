Sorted a doubly linked list of size N using quicksort. 
Created a function partition(), which accepts the first and last node of the given linked list as input parameters and returns the pivot's address. 
* Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
* Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
* Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 200
